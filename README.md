## **Description**

This is the project for week 7 at Epicodus to demonstrate profienciency with TDD in C#. It is a console app that allows a user to "order" a number of loaves of bread and a number of pastries, then the console will return the total for the order. 

## Complete Setup

- Clone this repository
- Open in VS Code or simply open your terminal
- Navigate to this project's production directory called _"Bakery"_ using the command `cd Bakery` in the command line.
- Then, run the command `dotnet run` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
- Optionally, you can run `dotnet build` to compile this console app without running it.

### To run tests
- Navigate to the `Bakery.Tests` directory
- In the command line, run the command `dotnet test`
